Strategic Storytelling / Future Headline:
Activity: In small groups, ask the team to imagine it's 2-3 years in the future and the team has achieved remarkable success. Their task is to write a newspaper headline and a short article (a few paragraphs) celebrating their achievements, outlining what they accomplished and how they did it.
Debrief: Groups share their "future headlines" and stories. The coach guides a discussion around the strategies, values, and collaborative efforts that would be necessary to make these headlines a reality.
Why it works: Forces forward-thinking, identifies desired outcomes, and highlights the journey and actions needed to reach success.


"Team Timeline" / "Journey Map":
Activity: Provide a long roll of paper or a whiteboard. As a whole team, or in smaller groups, map out the team's journey from its inception (or a significant past event) to the present, and then project it into the future. Mark key successes, challenges, learning moments, and changes.
Visual Elements: Encourage drawing, sticky notes for feelings/learnings, and connecting events with lines to show flow.
Debrief: Discuss the highs and lows, what they learned from challenges, what they're proud of, and how past experiences inform their future vision.
Why it works: Builds shared history, acknowledges collective achievements and struggles, and reinforces a sense of continuity and shared destiny.


Enhanced Team Activity: "Client Crisis & Collaborative Resolution"
Overall Goal: To strengthen team bonding, align on team vision (customer-centricity), and improve collaboration, negotiation, and influencing skills by navigating a complex client-facing scenario.
Core Scenario: Your team works for a leading transaction banking division. A major, long-standing commercial client (e.g., a large multinational corporate relying heavily on your cash management, trade finance, and liquidity solutions) is experiencing an unforeseen, severe operational disruption (e.g., a cyber-attack, a sudden supply chain collapse, a major regulatory compliance breach impacting their payments). This disruption directly impacts their ability to make critical payments, receive funds, or execute trade transactions, threatening their reputation and solvency.
Your bank's relationship with this client is at risk. Your team has been given 4 hours (real-time simulation) to develop and prioritize immediate actions and a mid-term recovery plan to support the client, mitigate their losses, and secure the bank's relationship, all while managing internal bank resources and policies.
Prop Requirement: Minimal â€“ just paper and pens for each participant, and potentially a whiteboard or flip chart for the coach. A pre-prepared scenario brief (2-3 paragraphs) for each participant.
